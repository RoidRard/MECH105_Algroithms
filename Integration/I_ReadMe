These Algorithms find the Integrals of functions and data sets alike

Anint is the only function that finds the analytical integral, it is actually just the built in integral function that
is combined in a function that makes it a little more esthetically pleasing in the sense that it also shows the 
function of the integral of the function.

The other algorithms employ numerical methods to essentially guess the best integral
