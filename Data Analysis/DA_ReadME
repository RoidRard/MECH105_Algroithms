Thes algorithms analyze data in the form of vectors.


Vstat can take up to three vectors and gives all the statistics of the individual vectors (mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, etc)

linearRegression takes two vectors and finds the linear line of best fit

Cfit takes two vectors and uses Vstat for some of the calculation, but it spits out the linear line of best fit, the power curve of
best fit, the logarithmic curve of best fit and the polynomial curve of best fit. For the polynomial curve of best fit you can choose
the preffered order of the polynomial. All the lines of best fit are accompanied with r^2 which relates to they accuracy.
