These algorithms find the roots of functions


There are two closed methods
require two guess points

root_ator_rdstr
This algorithm employs bisection

root_ator
this algorithm employs false point

root_inator
this is a failed algorithm. I tried to combine bisection and false point to get a fast and accurate root finding method

The rest are open methods

new_rap
Newton-Raphson

root_fp
fixed point

root_sec
secant method
